# DHSZ Programming Challenge 2

## Seven segment displays

Old style LCD displays are known as seven segment displays, these are the type of screens you will see on your calculator displaying the numbers. It is possible to write words using these types of displays but not all letters can be represented.

Your challenge is to find the largest possible English word that can be written using seven segment displays. A lost of possible letters is given as follows:

A, B, C, E, F, H, I, J, L, N, O, P, S, U, Y
